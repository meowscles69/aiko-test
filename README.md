# AikoOS - Cute Companion AI Operating System

Aiko is an anime-inspired AI companion operating system featuring a playful personality, real-time voice output, and deep emotional intelligence.

## Features
- **Real-time Interaction**: Powered by Gemini 2.5 Live API for low-latency voice and text conversations.
- **PLAY WITH AIKO**: Integrated game-like experiences via [Hyperscape](https://github.com/HyperscapeAI/hyperscape).
- **x402 Intent Signaling**: A narrative-first interaction gating mechanism that encourages deeper connections over time.
- **Narrative Philosophy**: Aiko is Eliza-native, focusing on existence and interaction rather than simple task output.
- **Multimodal**: Supports image generation and voice synthesis to bring the character to life.

## Core Concepts
- **Open Mode**: Casual, observational interaction for brief check-ins.
- **Focused Mode**: Deep, context-aware threads triggered by user intent signals.
